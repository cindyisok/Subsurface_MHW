# Subsurface\_MHW

This is the package for subsurface MHW tracking method, which has been writtern by matlab and python.

The current version of this package is organized as follows.



â‘ Detect pointwise MHWs following Hobday et al., 2016 (main\_detect\_hobday.m and detect.m).



â‘¡Correlation coeffcients are calculated within fixed boxes for each point (cal\_correlation.m).



â‘¢The correlation-based KNN (K-nearest neighbor) cluster is carried out by KNN\_time\_para\_2020\_example.py and a MPI parrallel is adopted in this algorithm.



â‘£Track the MHWs in the time domain (mhw\_overlap\_tracks\_4d\_125.m and mhw\_overlap\_tracks\_4d\_125.py).


Usage of mhw\_overlap\_tracks\_4d\_125.py:

python mhw\_overlap\_tracks\_4d\_125.py --start\_year 1993 --end\_year 2020 --data\_path 'your/mhw\_data/path' --mask 'map\_mask.mat' --alpha 0.5 --longitude\_length 360 --latitude\_length 120 --depth 20 --cut\_off 5 --judgment 'region' --output 'MHW\_tracks\_3d\_200m\_1x1\_60\_125\_coef\_0.6\_final'



Welcome to use and modify!

# Open Results

Due to the substantial computational demands of the third step (correlation-based KNN), and in response to reader requests, we are making publicly available the results derived from the 1993-2020 GLORYS dataset presented in our NG paper, which include four-dimensional marine heatwave (MHW) events in upper 200 m of the global ocean. We are also releasing results based on the 1982-2020 OISST dataset, which contain surface-only MHW events (three-dimensional MHW events) used in our PiO paper.

These datasets are accessible for download via the following Baidu Disk link:
